There are 3 types of Services
1. IAAS (Infrastructure As A Service) - making your own software from scratch, they provide software
2. PAAS (Platform As A Service) - browse application/AWS EMR
3. SAAS (Software As A Service) - you would just pick it up as they provide the software

Data is a piece of information

OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
OLAP (Online Analytical  Processing)
OLTP has RDBMS (Oracle, MySql, Postages, Sql Server) which are not scalable & NOSQL (Cassandra, MongDB) that are scalable.
NOSQL is also schemeless
OLAP uses Data Warehouse


Hadoop

Hadoop involves D.C.F, Fault Tolerant & High Availability. 
The 2 services Hadoop provide are processing and storage. 
Processing uses Map Reduce & YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiater). Storage uses HDF
Storage are called blocks in Hadoop

Hadoop DAEMONS/Processor
1. NameNode - metadata(data about data)
2. DataNode - physical data
3. Secondary NameNode - checkpointing (merging of edit log file & fs image file)
4. Resource Manager - Resource allocation
5. Node Manager - Task Execution (executing task on the slave machine)

High availability aims to ensure an agreed level of operational performance usually uptime, for a higher than normal period
Kerberos - a dog with 3 head (not to be confused with Cerberus)
Fault Tolerant has no service of interrruption but a significantly higher cost. High availability has minimal service interruption.
Fault Tolerant - all operations mirrored to the backup server

SQOOP - ingesting data
HIVE - DWS in Hadoop
FLUME - Near real time data, ingestion tool
PIG/PIG LATIN - transforming/converting language into transaction
HBASE - OLTP(ACID)

Types of Data
1. Structured (Sql table)
2. Semi-Structure (sov, csv, xme)
3. Un-Structure (audio/text/video)
